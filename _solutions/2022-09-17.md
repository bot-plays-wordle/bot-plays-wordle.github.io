# Wordle for September 17, 2022

## Attempt 1

Right now we have 8497 words to choose from

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Let's start with word `drant`

Analyzing results for word `drant`

Letter `d` is not present in the word. We will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word. We will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word. We will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word. We will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot. This means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `r`, `a`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information
