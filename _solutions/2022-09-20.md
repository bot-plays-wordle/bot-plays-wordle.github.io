# Wordle for September 20, 2022

## Attempt 1

Right now we have 8497 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[trend lenth alert alter artel]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Let's start with word `trend`

![Attempt 1](2022-09-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trend` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2135 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[haole halse leash selah shale]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `haole`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
