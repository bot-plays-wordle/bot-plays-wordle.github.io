# Wordle for September 22, 2022 - \#460

## Attempt 1

Right now we have 8497 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[trend lenth alert alter artel]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Let's start with word `trend`

![Attempt 1](2022-09-22/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trend` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` should be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

At position 4: `[n]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`
