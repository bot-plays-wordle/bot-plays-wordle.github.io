# Wordle for September 23, 2022 - \#461

## Attempt 1

Right now we have 8497 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[trend lenth alert alter artel]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Let's start with word `trend`

![Attempt 1](2022-09-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trend` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `e`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`
