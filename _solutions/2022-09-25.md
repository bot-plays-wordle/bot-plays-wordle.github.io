So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Let's start with word `trend`

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5
