# Wordle for September 29, 2022 - \#467

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `toner`

![Attempt 1](2022-09-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `toner` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `o`, `n`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1062 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[hauld dhyal child duali dulia]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dhyal`, let's see what it gives us
