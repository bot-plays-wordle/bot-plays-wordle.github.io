# Wordle for September 29, 2022

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `unlet`

![Attempt 1](2022-09-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `unlet` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `n`, `e`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2
