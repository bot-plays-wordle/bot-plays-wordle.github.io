# Wordle for October 3, 2022

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `drest`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `drest` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[s t]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2489 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[slath snath sloth stola litas]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `sloth`, let's see what it gives us
