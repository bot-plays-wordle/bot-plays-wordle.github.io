# Wordle for October 5, 2022

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `telyn`

Wordle does not know word `telyn`, need to try something different

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `artel`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-05/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `artel` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `e`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2039 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[radon dinar nadir ranid rohan]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `rohan`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-10-05/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `rohan` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r h]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
