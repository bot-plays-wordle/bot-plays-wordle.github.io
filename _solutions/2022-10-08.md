# Wordle for October 8, 2022

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `retin`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `retin` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `t`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r i]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2226 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laird liard shirl idryl drill]`

So far we know that possible letters are:
