# Wordle for October 12, 2022 - \#480

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `dater`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-12/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `dater` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `a`, `t`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
