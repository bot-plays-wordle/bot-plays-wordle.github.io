# Wordle for October 14, 2022 - \#482

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `inter`

Attempt for `inter` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `t`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information
