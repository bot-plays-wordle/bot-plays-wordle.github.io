# Wordle for October 16, 2022 - \#484

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `terna`

Wordle does not know word `terna`, need to try something different

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `hater`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `hater` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `t`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a e]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2508 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eland lenad alone anole olena]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lenad`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `lenad`, need to try something different

## Attempt 2
