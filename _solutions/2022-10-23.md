# Wordle for October 23, 2022 - \#491

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `retan`

Wordle does not know word `retan`, need to try something different

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `antre`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `antre` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `n`, `t`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dhoul`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `dhoul`, need to try something different

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3
