# Wordle for October 26, 2022 - \#494

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `redan`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-26/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `redan` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `d`, `a`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 938 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[litho thiol tholi sloth hotly]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `thiol`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-10-26/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `thiol` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t o l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
