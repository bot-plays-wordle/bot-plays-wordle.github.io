# Wordle for October 28, 2022 - \#496

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `arent`

Wordle does not know word `arent`, need to try something different

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `orlet`

Let's start with word `retin`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-28/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `retin` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `t`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e n]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2307 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eland unled blend alone anole]`

So far we know that possible letters are:
