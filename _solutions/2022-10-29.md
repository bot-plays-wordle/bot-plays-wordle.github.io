# Wordle for October 29, 2022 - \#497

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `drest`

![Attempt 1](2022-10-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `drest` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `r`, `s`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2151 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lench alone anole alien anile]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `alone`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-10-29/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `alone` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `o`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
