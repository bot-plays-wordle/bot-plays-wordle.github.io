# Wordle for November 1, 2022 - \#500

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `daler`

Wordle does not know word `daler`, need to try something different

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `urent`

![Attempt 1](2022-11-01/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `urent` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `r`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e n]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2728 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laden lenad olden eldin lined]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `olden`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-11-01/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `olden` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `l`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k m n p q s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k m p q s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `kaneh`, let's see what it gives us
