# Wordle for November 8, 2022 - \#507

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `liner`

![Attempt 1](2022-11-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `liner` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l e]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2400 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dealt delta ethal thole ethyl]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ethyl`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
