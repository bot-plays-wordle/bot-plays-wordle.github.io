# Wordle for November 14, 2022 - \#513

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `other`

![Attempt 1](2022-11-14/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `other` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `t`, `h`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2039 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eland lenad eldin blend neeld]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`
