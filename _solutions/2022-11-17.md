# Wordle for November 17, 2022 - \#516

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `drate`

Wordle does not know word `drate`, need to try something different

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4
