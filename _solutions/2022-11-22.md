# Wordle for November 22, 2022 - \#521

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lenth`

Wordle does not know word `lenth`, need to try something different

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `other`

![Attempt 1](2022-11-22/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `other` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `t`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2998 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[learn renal arend redan redly]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `learn`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-11-22/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `learn` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `a`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 379 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[ureid druse pride bredi bride]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g i j k m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `bredi`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `bredi`, need to try something different

At position 4: `[b c d f g i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ureid`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2022-11-22/attempt-3.png)

Attempt for `ureid` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Next guess is `prime`, let's see what it gives us

That's the correct answer! The word is `prime`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.

## Conclusion

Today's word is `prime` and it took 4 attempts to guess it
