# Wordle for November 25, 2022 - \#524

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `entry`

![Attempt 1](2022-11-25/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `entry` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `n`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t y]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 535 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laity taily lasty salty slaty]`
