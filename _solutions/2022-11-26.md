# Wordle for November 26, 2022 - \#525

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `entry`

![Attempt 1](2022-11-26/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `entry` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e n]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2914 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laden olden lined blend lench]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

Next guess is `laden`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-11-26/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `laden` gives us 1 correct letters, 3 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e n l a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
