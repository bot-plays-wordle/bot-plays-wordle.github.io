# Wordle for December 3, 2022 - \#532

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `toher`

Wordle does not know word `toher`, need to try something different

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `inter`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `inter` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t r]`

Could be a better guess
