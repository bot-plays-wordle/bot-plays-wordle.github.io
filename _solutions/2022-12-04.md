# Wordle for December 4, 2022 - \#533

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tried`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-04/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tried` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e d]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 3265 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[redan redly ronde derah horde]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `horde`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-12-04/attempt-2.png)
