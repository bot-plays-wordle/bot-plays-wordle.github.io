# Wordle for December 6, 2022 - \#535

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tread`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-06/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tread` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e a]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 3946 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[learn haler laser slare alure]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `slare`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `slare`, need to try something different

## Attempt 2

Right now we have 3945 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[learn haler laser alure early]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `haler`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-12-06/attempt-2.png)

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
