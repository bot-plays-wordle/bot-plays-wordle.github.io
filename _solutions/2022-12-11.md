# Wordle for December 11, 2022 - \#540

## Attempt 1

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e n]`

Could be a better guess
