# Wordle for December 12, 2022 - \#541

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rated`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-12/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rated` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `t`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1584 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lohan linha uhlan aloin anoil]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `anoil`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `anoil`, need to try something different

## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1583 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lohan linha uhlan aloin anoli]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `aloin`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-12-12/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `aloin` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
