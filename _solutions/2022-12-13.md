# Wordle for December 13, 2022 - \#542

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `glent`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-13/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `glent` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `g`, `l`, `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 2489 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[derah horde hider hired shred]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `derah`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `derah`, need to try something different
