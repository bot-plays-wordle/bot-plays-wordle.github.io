# Wordle for December 15, 2022 - \#544

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `toner`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `toner` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `o`, `n`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 484 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drail laird liard dural lardy]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lardy`, let's see what it gives us
