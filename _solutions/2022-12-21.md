# Wordle for December 21, 2022 - \#550

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `redly`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-21/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `redly` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `d`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 126 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[thirl thurl latro toral litra]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x z]`

Next guess is `latro`, let's see what it gives us
