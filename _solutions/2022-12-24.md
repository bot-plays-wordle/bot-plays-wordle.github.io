# Wordle for December 24, 2022 - \#553

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `idler`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `idler` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `l`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
