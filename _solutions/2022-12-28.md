# Wordle for December 28, 2022 - \#557

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rathe`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-28/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rathe` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `a`, `t`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 520 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[olden eldin lined unled blend]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `eldin`, let's see what it gives us
