# Wordle for December 29, 2022 - \#558

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `inert`

![Attempt 1](2022-12-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `inert` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `e`, `r`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1110 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[hauld alody shoal shola acold]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `acold`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2022-12-29/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `acold` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `c` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a c o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 4: `[a b c f g h j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `poach`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `p`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a c o h]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c f g h j k m o q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c f g j k m q s u v x y z]`

At position 4: `[o]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g j k m o q s u v x y z]`

It must be `havoc`
