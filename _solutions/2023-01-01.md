# Wordle for January 1, 2023 - \#561

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `niter`

![Attempt 1](2023-01-01/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `niter` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n i e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 74 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eldin anile elain laine enoil]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `laine`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `laine`, need to try something different

## Attempt 2

Right now we have 73 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eldin anile elain enoil ileon]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `enoil`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `enoil`, need to try something different

## Attempt 2

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ileon`, let's see what it gives us

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `elsin`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-01-01/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `elsin` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `s`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n i e]`

Could be a better guess

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `deink`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2023-01-01/attempt-3.png)

Attempt for `deink` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `i` should be at position 3

Letter `n` should be at position 4

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `k`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n i e]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 4

Right now we have 12 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[haine chine whine amine gaine]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j m o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h j m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[i]`

At position 4: `[n]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j m o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `whine`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 4](2023-01-01/attempt-4.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `whine`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.
