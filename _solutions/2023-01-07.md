# Wordle for January 7, 2023 - \#567

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ratel`

![Attempt 1](2023-01-07/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ratel` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `a`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 223 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eldin blend neeld dhole sheld]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `neeld`, let's see what it gives us
