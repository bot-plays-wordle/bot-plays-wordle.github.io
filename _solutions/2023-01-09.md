# Wordle for January 9, 2023 - \#569

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ental`

Wordle does not know word `ental`, need to try something different

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `drest`

![Attempt 1](2023-01-09/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `drest` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `r`, `s`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 721 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[alone anole alien anile elain]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `elain`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
