# Wordle for January 15, 2023 - \#575

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `snare`

![Attempt 1](2023-01-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `snare` gives us 3 correct letters, 0 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` should be at position 1

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 4

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[s r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 15 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[store shore shire shure score]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[s]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `store`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
