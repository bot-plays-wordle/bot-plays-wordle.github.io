# Wordle for January 19, 2023 - \#579

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lower`

![Attempt 1](2023-01-19/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `lower` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `o`, `w`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1260 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[idant stand daunt ahint hiant]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q s t u v x y z]`

Next guess is `idant`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-01-19/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `idant` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `d`, `a`, `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

Letter `y` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[c u y]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 4

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b f g j k m p q u v x y z]`
