# Wordle for January 28, 2023 - \#588

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tired`

![Attempt 1](2023-01-28/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tired` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t i r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 34 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[snirt flirt rutin print shirt]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `rutin`, let's see what it gives us

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...

Not a bad guess in general
