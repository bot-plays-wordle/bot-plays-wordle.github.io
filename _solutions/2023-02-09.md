# Wordle for February 9, 2023 - \#600

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `idler`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-09/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `idler` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `d`, `l`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 645 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[enhat neath thane tench thegn]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c e f g h j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `thane`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-02-09/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `thane` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` should be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 11 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[spate stage ovate skate stake]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g j k m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `ovate`, let's see what it gives us

Not a bad guess in general

At position 1: `[a b c e f g j k m p q s u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g j k m p q s u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`
