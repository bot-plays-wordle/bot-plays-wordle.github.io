# Wordle for February 11, 2023 - \#602

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `horde`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `horde` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `o`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[d e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 208 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[adlet dealt delta lated eland]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f g i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `eland`, let's see what it gives us
