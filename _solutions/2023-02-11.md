# Wordle for February 11, 2023 - \#602

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tuner`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tuner` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `n`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[u e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 101 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lehua leuch peuhl udell amelu]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `peuhl`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `peuhl`, need to try something different

## Attempt 2

Right now we have 100 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lehua leuch udell amelu leuma]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`
