# Wordle for February 13, 2023 - \#604

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rivel`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-13/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rivel` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `i`, `v`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
