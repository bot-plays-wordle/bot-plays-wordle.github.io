# Wordle for February 15, 2023 - \#606

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lento`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `lento` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `n`, `t`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 487 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drail dural drawl ralph wharl]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `wharl`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `wharl`, need to try something different

## Attempt 2

Right now we have 486 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drail dural drawl ralph hurly]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dural`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-02-15/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `dural` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `u`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l a]`

Not a bad guess in general

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k m p q s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m p q s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c f g h i j k l m p q s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k m p q s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `milha`, let's see what it gives us

Wordle does not know word `milha`, need to try something different

## Attempt 3

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

It must be `balsa`
