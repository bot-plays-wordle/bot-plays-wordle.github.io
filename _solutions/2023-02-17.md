# Wordle for February 17, 2023 - \#608

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rhine`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-17/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rhine` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[h e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 28 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lathe haole haste halse tache]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `haste`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-02-17/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `haste` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` should be at position 2

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more
