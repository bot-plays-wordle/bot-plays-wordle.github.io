# Wordle for February 20, 2023 - \#611

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `veldt`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `veldt` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `v`, `l`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 113 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[inert urent brent chert caret]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[t]`

Next guess is `chert`, let's see what it gives us

Not a bad guess in general
