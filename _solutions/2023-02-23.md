# Wordle for February 23, 2023 - \#614

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `norie`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `norie` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `o`, `r`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
