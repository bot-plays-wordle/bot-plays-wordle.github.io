# Wordle for February 27, 2023 - \#618

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `taker`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `taker` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `k` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `a`, `k`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 309 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[enrol drone ronde redly heron]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g h i j l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `heron`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information
