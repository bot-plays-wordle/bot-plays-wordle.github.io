# Wordle for February 28, 2023 - \#619

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `mitre`

![Attempt 1](2023-02-28/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `mitre` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `i`, `t`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1196 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal laund ulnad lohan bland]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `bland`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more
