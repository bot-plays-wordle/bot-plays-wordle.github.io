# Wordle for March 2, 2023 - \#621

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `range`

![Attempt 1](2023-03-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `range` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `n`, `g`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 123 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[alite plate blate twale alate]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `stale`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-03-02/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `stale` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `t`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 13 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[abode adobe amide abide awide]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f h i j k m o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f h i j k m o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f h i j k m o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `amide`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `i`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 4

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a]`

At position 2: `[b c e f h j k o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c e f h j k o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f h j k o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `awoke`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 4](2023-03-02/attempt-4.png)

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` should be at position 3

Letter `k` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...

At position 1: `[a]`

At position 2: `[b c e f h j o p q u v x y z]`

At position 3: `[o]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f h j o p q u v x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

It must be `above`

![Attempt 5](2023-03-02/attempt-5.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `above`!

Today's word is `above` and it took 5 attempts to guess it
