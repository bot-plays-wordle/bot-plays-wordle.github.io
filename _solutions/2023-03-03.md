# Wordle for March 3, 2023 - \#622

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `write`

![Attempt 1](2023-03-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `write` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `w`, `r`, `i`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 352 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notal ontal talon tolan tonal]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v x y z]`

Next guess is `talon`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-03-03/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `talon` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `o`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
