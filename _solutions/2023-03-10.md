# Wordle for March 10, 2023 - \#629

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `inter`

![Attempt 1](2023-03-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `inter` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 90 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[arles shred ravel morel rowel]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `morel`, let's see what it gives us
