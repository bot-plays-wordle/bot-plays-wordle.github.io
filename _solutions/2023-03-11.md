# Wordle for March 11, 2023 - \#630

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `gruel`

![Attempt 1](2023-03-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `gruel` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `g`, `r`, `u`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 53 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[ethal ethyl setal steal ectal]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f h i j k l m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f h i j k l m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f h i j k l m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h i j k l m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[l]`

Next guess is `ethyl`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-03-11/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `ethyl` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more
