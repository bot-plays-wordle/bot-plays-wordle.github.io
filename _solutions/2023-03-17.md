Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `i`, `r`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`
