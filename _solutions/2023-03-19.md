# Wordle for March 19, 2023 - \#638

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ravel`

![Attempt 1](2023-03-19/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ravel` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `v`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 282 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[tenor trone inert trine stern]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

Next guess is `trine`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-03-19/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `trine` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

Letter `r` should be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
