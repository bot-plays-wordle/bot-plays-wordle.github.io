# Wordle for March 23, 2023 - \#642

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `therm`

![Attempt 1](2023-03-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `therm` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `e`, `r`, `m`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`
