# Wordle for March 26, 2023 - \#645

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `drone`

![Attempt 1](2023-03-26/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `drone` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `r`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n e]`
