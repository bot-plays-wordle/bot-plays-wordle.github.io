# Wordle for April 4, 2023 - \#654

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `knelt`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-04/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `knelt` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `k` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `k`, `n`, `e`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 488 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[triad darts strad dutra torah]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `strad`, let's see what it gives us
