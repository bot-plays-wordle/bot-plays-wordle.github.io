# Wordle for April 5, 2023 - \#655

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `roset`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-05/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `roset` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `o`, `e`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[s]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 355 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[slain snail glans slang slank]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n p q u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `slain`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-04-05/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `slain` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
