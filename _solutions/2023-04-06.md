# Wordle for April 6, 2023 - \#656

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `haler`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-06/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `haler` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a l e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 119 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[leant dealt eland alite least]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `eland`, let's see what it gives us
