# Wordle for April 8, 2023 - \#658

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `blare`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `blare` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `a`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 92 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[tilde thole lithe dhole stole]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `thole`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `thole` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l e]`

Not a bad guess in general
