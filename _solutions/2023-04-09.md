# Wordle for April 9, 2023 - \#659

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `three`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-09/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `three` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1889 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal nidal laund ulnad bland]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `bland`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `bland` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` should be at position 3

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
