# Wordle for April 12, 2023 - \#662

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `yearn`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-12/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `yearn` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `y`, `e`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 330 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[rotal trial altar artal ratal]`

Next guess is `trial`, let's see what it gives us
