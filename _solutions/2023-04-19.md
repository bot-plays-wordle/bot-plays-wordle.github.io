# Wordle for April 19, 2023 - \#669

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `irate`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-19/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `irate` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `r`, `a`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 135 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[blunt stond hotly toldo notch]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `notch`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `notch` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `o`, `c`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t h]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 3 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[thump thumb thymy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 5: `[b d f g j k l m p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `thumb`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `b`) but it's also important piece of information

Could be a better guess
