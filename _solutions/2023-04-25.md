# Wordle for April 25, 2023 - \#675

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `trend`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-25/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trend` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 536 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[haler laser seral alure early]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `haler`, let's see what it gives us
