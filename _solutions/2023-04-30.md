# Wordle for April 30, 2023 - \#680

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tuner`

![Attempt 1](2023-04-30/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tuner` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `u`, `n`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1096 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[child dolia idola acold daily]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `daily`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-04-30/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `daily` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `i`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 64 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[shoal loach omlah clash plash]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h j k l m o p q s v w x z]`

At position 2: `[b c f g h j k l m o p q s v w x z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h j k l m o p q s v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h j k m o p q s v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h j k l m o p q s v w x z]`

Next guess is `plash`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2023-04-30/attempt-3.png)

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a l p]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
