# Wordle for May 2, 2023 - \#682

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `realm`

![Attempt 1](2023-05-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `realm` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `a`, `m`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
