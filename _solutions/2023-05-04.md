# Wordle for May 4, 2023 - \#684

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `later`

![Attempt 1](2023-05-04/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `later` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `a`, `t`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 658 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dhoni hundi unhid dunch dhoon]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `hound`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-05-04/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `hound` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `o`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[u]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 3: `[b c f g i j k m p q s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c f g i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c f g i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `pubis`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
