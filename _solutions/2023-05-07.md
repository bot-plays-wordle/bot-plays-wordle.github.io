# Wordle for May 7, 2023 - \#687

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lento`

![Attempt 1](2023-05-07/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `lento` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 209 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[horal world dolor droll drool]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `drool`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-05-07/attempt-2.png)

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
