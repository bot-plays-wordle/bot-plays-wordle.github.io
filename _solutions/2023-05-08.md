# Wordle for May 8, 2023 - \#688

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `resin`

![Attempt 1](2023-05-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `resin` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `s`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 936 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dotal adult altho loath lathy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `loath`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-05-08/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `loath` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Word should contain letters `[l o a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
