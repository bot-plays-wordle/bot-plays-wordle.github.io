# Wordle for May 14, 2023 - \#694

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ethal`

![Attempt 1](2023-05-14/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ethal` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `t`, `h`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 830 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[adorn radon drain nadir ranid]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `drain`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-05-14/attempt-2.png)

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information
