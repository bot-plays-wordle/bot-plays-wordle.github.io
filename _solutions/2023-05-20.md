# Wordle for May 20, 2023 - \#700

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `trike`

![Attempt 1](2023-05-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trike` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `k` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `i`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[k]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 145 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[kalon slank clank blank dukhn]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `blank`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-05-20/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `blank` gives us 3 correct letters, 0 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `l` should be at position 2

Letter `a` should be at position 3

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
