# Wordle for May 29, 2023 - \#709

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `trend`

![Attempt 1](2023-05-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trend` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 657 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[haole halse leash selah shale]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `shale`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-05-29/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `shale` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `a`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e s]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 22 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[biose youse mouse cusie bouse]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c e f g i j k m o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c e f g i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c f g i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c e f g i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `mouse`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2023-05-29/attempt-3.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `mouse`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.
