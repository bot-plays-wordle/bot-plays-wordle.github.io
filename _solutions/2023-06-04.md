# Wordle for June 4, 2023 - \#715

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `flier`

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `f`, `l`, `i`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
