# Wordle for June 6, 2023 - \#717

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `carte`

![Attempt 1](2023-06-06/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `carte` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[c t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 57 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notch ditch dutch lotic tonic]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ditch`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[c t u]`

Not a bad guess in general
