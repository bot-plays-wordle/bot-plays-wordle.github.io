# Wordle for June 23, 2023 - \#734

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `letch`

![Attempt 1](2023-06-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `letch` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `c` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t c]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 23 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[caret carte crate crest cruet]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d e f g i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `caret`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Not a bad guess in general
