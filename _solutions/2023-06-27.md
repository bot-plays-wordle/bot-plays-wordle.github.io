# Wordle for June 27, 2023 - \#738

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `three`

![Attempt 1](2023-06-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `three` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 491 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notal ontal slant plant until]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `slant`, let's see what it gives us
