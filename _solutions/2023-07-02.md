# Wordle for July 2, 2023 - \#743

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `regal`

![Attempt 1](2023-07-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `regal` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `g`, `a`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
