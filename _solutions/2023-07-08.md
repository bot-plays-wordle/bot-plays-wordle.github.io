# Wordle for July 8, 2023 - \#749

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `overt`

![Attempt 1](2023-07-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `overt` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `v`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 127 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[enrol drone ronde heron reoil]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q r s u w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u w x y z]`

Next guess is `enrol`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-07-08/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `enrol` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information
