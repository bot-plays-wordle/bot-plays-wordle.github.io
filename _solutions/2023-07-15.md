# Wordle for July 15, 2023 - \#756

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tripe`

![Attempt 1](2023-07-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tripe` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `i`, `p`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 55 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drone crone krone grade drake]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[r]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `crone`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-07-15/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `crone`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.

## Conclusion

Today's word is `crone` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
