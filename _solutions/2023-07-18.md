# Wordle for July 18, 2023 - \#759

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `voter`

![Attempt 1](2023-07-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `voter` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `v`, `o`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 210 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[liner alder lader haler idler]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q r s u w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q r s u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[r]`

Next guess is `idler`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information
