# Wordle for July 22, 2023 - \#763

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tired`

![Attempt 1](2023-07-22/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tired` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `i`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 236 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[learn renal henry alure ureal]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c e f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `henry`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-07-22/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `henry` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more
