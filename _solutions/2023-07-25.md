# Wordle for July 25, 2023 - \#766

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `peril`

![Attempt 1](2023-07-25/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `peril` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `r`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 61 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[ethal ethyl steal canel agnel]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[l]`

Next guess is `ethyl`, let's see what it gives us
