# Wordle for July 29, 2023 - \#770

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ergon`

![Attempt 1](2023-07-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ergon` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `g`, `o`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 457 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[thirl thurl slart ultra clart]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f h i j k l m p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `third`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-07-29/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `third` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `i`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 91 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[sural carls mural rumal acryl]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f j k l m p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f j k l m p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `mural`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2023-07-29/attempt-3.png)

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r u l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

At position 1: `[b c f j k l p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[r]`

At position 4: `[b c f j k l p q s u v w x y z]`
