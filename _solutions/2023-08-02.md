# Wordle for August 2, 2023 - \#774

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ramet`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ramet` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `a`, `m`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 50 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[inlet unlet islet onset inset]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f g h i j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f g h i j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[t]`

Next guess is `onset`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-08-02/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `onset` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `n`, `s`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 21 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[culet filet bluet bidet civet]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l p q t u v w x y z]`
