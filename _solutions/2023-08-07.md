# Wordle for August 7, 2023 - \#779

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rhine`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-07/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rhine` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `i`, `n`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
