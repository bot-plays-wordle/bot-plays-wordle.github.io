# Wordle for August 8, 2023 - \#780

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `glent`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `glent` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `g`, `e`, `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 509 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drail laird liard dural lardy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dural`, let's see what it gives us
