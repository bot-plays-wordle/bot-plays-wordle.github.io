# Wordle for August 10, 2023 - \#782

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `delft`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `delft` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `l`, `f`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 254 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[antre noter toner trone inter]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c e g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `toner`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-08-10/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `toner` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `n`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 55 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[hiate haste sithe stech kithe]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 5: `[a b c e g h i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ethic`, let's see what it gives us

At position 1: `[e]`

At position 2: `[a b g j k m p q s u v w x y z]`
