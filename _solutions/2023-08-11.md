# Wordle for August 11, 2023 - \#783

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `alder`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `alder` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `d`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 175 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lento knelt thole lithe ethyl]`
