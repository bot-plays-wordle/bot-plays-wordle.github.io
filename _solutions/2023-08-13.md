# Wordle for August 13, 2023 - \#785

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `brent`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-13/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `brent` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 2

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `e`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 50 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[trail trial trawl artal truly]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[r]`

At position 3: `[a c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `truly`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-08-13/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `truly` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `l`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r t]`

Not a bad guess in general
