# Wordle for August 16, 2023 - \#788

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `teary`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `teary` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `e`, `a`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`
