# Wordle for August 18, 2023 - \#790

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `throe`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `throe` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `r`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 203 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laten leant inlet unlet blent]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `inlet`, let's see what it gives us
