# Wordle for August 20, 2023 - \#792

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tilde`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tilde` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `l`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 225 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[noter stern urent entry brent]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c e f g h j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f g h j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `entry`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-08-20/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `entry` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `r`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t e]`

Could be a better guess

It must be `guest`
