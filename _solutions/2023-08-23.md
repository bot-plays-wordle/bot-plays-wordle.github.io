# Wordle for August 23, 2023 - \#795

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `write`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `write` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `w`, `i`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

Next guess is `ronde`, let's see what it gives us
