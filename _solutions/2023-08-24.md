# Wordle for August 24, 2023 - \#796

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `blear`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `blear` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `e`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 398 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[north thorn nitro snort snirt]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `thorn`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information
