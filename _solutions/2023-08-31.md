# Wordle for August 31, 2023 - \#803

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `react`

![Attempt 1](2023-08-31/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `react` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `c`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 329 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[enrol liner older idler drone]`
