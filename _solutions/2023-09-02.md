# Wordle for September 2, 2023 - \#805

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `eldin`

![Attempt 1](2023-09-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `eldin` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `l`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 29 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[cairn bairn airan prion viron]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[n]`

Next guess is `bairn`, let's see what it gives us
