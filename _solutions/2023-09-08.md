# Wordle for September 8, 2023 - \#811

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `brine`

![Attempt 1](2023-09-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `brine` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
