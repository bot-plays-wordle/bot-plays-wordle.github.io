# Wordle for September 11, 2023 - \#814

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `henry`

![Attempt 1](2023-09-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `henry` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `n`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2
