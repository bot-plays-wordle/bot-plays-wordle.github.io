# Wordle for September 15, 2023 - \#818

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `remit`

![Attempt 1](2023-09-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `remit` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
