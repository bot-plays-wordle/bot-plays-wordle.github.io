# Wordle for September 16, 2023 - \#819

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `nurse`

![Attempt 1](2023-09-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `nurse` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `r`, `s`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 229 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laten leant lento olent inlet]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lento`, let's see what it gives us
