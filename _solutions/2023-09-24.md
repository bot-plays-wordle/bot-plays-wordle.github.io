# Wordle for September 24, 2023 - \#827

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `remit`

![Attempt 1](2023-09-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `remit` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` should be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `m`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r i t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 3 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[riant richt right]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[r]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[t]`

Next guess is `right`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-09-24/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `right`!

## Conclusion

Today's word is `right` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
