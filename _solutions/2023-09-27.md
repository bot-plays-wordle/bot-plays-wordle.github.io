# Wordle for September 27, 2023 - \#830

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `laden`

![Attempt 1](2023-09-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `laden` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `d`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
