# Wordle for September 30, 2023 - \#833

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `wrest`

![Attempt 1](2023-09-30/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `wrest` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `w`, `r`, `e`, `s`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1393 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal nidal laund ulnad lohan]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v x y z]`

Next guess is `lohan`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-09-30/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lohan` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `o`, `h`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

So far we know that possible letters are:
