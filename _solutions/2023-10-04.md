# Wordle for October 4, 2023 - \#837

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `liver`

![Attempt 1](2023-10-04/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `liver` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `i`, `v`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 669 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drant north thorn orant rotan]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k m n o p q r s t u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

Next guess is `thorn`, let's see what it gives us
