# Wordle for October 5, 2023 - \#838

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `feral`

![Attempt 1](2023-10-05/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `feral` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `f`, `e`, `r`, `a`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 879 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[stond notch shunt month thong]`

At position 1: `[b c d g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `month`, let's see what it gives us
