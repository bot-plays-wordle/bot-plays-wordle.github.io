# Wordle for October 6, 2023 - \#839

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `fetor`

![Attempt 1](2023-10-06/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `fetor` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `f`, `t`, `o`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 706 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eland laden eldin lined unled]`

At position 1: `[a b c d e g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `unled`, let's see what it gives us
