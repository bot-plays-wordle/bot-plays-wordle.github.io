# Wordle for October 11, 2023 - \#844

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `alert`

![Attempt 1](2023-10-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `alert` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `l`, `e`, `r`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 630 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dhoni unhid dunch dhoon hondo]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dunch`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-10-11/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `dunch` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `c`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[u n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 3: `[b f g i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b f g i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b f g i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `bosun`, let's see what it gives us

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[u n s]`

Not a bad guess in general

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[f g i j k m n p q s u v w x y z]`
