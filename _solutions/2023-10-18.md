# Wordle for October 18, 2023 - \#851

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `luger`

![Attempt 1](2023-10-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `luger` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `u`, `g`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 390 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[antre trone inert retin trine]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f h i j k m n o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f h i j k m n o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f h i j k m n o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h i j k m n o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `inert`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-10-18/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `inert` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 110 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[deray ready derma drape drake]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f h j k m o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f h j k m o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f h j k m o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h j k m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f h j k m o p q s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `derma`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `e` should be at position 2

Letter `r` should be at position 3

Letter `m` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r m]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
