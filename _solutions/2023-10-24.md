# Wordle for October 24, 2023 - \#857

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `teras`

![Attempt 1](2023-10-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `teras` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e a s]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 75 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[slane slade halse shale ashen]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ashen`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-10-24/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `ashen` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e a s]`

Could be a better guess

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 4: `[b c d f g i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g i j k l m o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lapse`, let's see what it gives us

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
