# Wordle for October 28, 2023 - \#861

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `negro`

![Attempt 1](2023-10-28/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `negro` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `g`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 174 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[ontal talon tolan tonal lohan]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `tonal`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more
