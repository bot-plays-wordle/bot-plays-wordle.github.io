# Wordle for October 30, 2023 - \#863

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `goner`

![Attempt 1](2023-10-30/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `goner` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `g` should be at position 1

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `n`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[g r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 33 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[garth girth grith grail glary]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[g]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `grail`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-10-30/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `grail`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.

## Conclusion

Today's word is `grail` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
