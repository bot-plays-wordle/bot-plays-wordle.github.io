# Wordle for November 1, 2023 - \#865

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ogler`

![Attempt 1](2023-11-01/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ogler` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `g`, `l`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 163 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[atone seton steno cento conte]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f h i j k m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `atone`, let's see what it gives us
