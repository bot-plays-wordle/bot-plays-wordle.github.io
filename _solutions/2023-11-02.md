# Wordle for November 2, 2023 - \#866

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `laver`

![Attempt 1](2023-11-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `laver` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `v`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 346 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[until clint glint flint blunt]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

Next guess is `until`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-11-02/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `until`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.

## Conclusion

Today's word is `until` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
