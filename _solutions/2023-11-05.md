# Wordle for November 5, 2023 - \#869

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `eruct`

![Attempt 1](2023-11-05/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `eruct` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `c`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

At position 5: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lader`, let's see what it gives us
