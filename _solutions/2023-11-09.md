# Wordle for November 9, 2023 - \#873

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lacer`

![Attempt 1](2023-11-09/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `lacer` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l a e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 109 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dealt delta eland ethal heald]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ethal`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-11-09/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `ethal` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l a e]`

Could be a better guess

Not a bad guess in general
