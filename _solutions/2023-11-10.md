# Wordle for November 10, 2023 - \#874

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `teras`

![Attempt 1](2023-11-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `teras` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e a s]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 21 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[leash deash mensa selva lease]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[e]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `mensa`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-11-10/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `mensa` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` should be at position 4

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e a s]`

Could be a better guess
