# Wordle for November 19, 2023 - \#883

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `liner`

![Attempt 1](2023-11-19/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `liner` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `i`, `n`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 505 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[death depth stade stead adept]`
