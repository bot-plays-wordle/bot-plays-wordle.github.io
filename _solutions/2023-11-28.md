# Wordle for November 28, 2023 - \#892

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `antre`

![Attempt 1](2023-11-28/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `antre` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `n`, `t`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 279 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dhole sidle slide duole dulse]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dulse`, let's see what it gives us
