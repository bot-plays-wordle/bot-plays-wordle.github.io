# Wordle for November 29, 2023 - \#893

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tetra`

![Attempt 1](2023-11-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tetra` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `e`, `r`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 959 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[unold unlid blind linch lunch]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lunch`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-11-29/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lunch` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` should be at position 2

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `n`, `c`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[u h]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 10 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[mushy bushy gushy sushi husky]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b d f g h i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b d f g h i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b d f g i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `bushy`, let's see what it gives us

At position 3: `[s]`

At position 4: `[h]`
