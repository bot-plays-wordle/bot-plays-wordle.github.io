# Wordle for December 6, 2023 - \#900

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `gruel`

![Attempt 1](2023-12-06/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `gruel` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `g`, `r`, `u`, `e`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1210 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[idant stand ahint hiant snath]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `stand`, let's see what it gives us

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `t`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
