# Wordle for December 16, 2023 - \#910

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `pearl`

![Attempt 1](2023-12-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `pearl` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `a`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 202 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[olent inlet unlet blent glent]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `inlet`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-12-16/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `inlet` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e l]`

Could be a better guess

So far we know that possible letters are:
