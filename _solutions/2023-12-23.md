# Wordle for December 23, 2023 - \#917

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `inure`

![Attempt 1](2023-12-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `inure` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `u`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 301 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lathe thole dhole blate stole]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `thole`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2023-12-23/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `thole` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` should be at position 3

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e o l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 10 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[alose alowe slope ploce bloke]`
