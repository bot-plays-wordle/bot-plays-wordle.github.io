# Wordle for December 24, 2023 - \#918

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `siren`

![Attempt 1](2023-12-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `siren` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 247 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[alert tread rathe trode redly]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q r t u v w x y z]`
