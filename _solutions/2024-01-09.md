# Wordle for January 9, 2024 - \#934

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `oriel`

![Attempt 1](2024-01-09/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `oriel` gives us 1 correct letters, 3 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r i e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 12 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[liter tiler liner idler riley]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m n p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `idler`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `idler` gives us 2 correct letters, 2 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more
