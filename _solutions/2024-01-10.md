# Wordle for January 10, 2024 - \#935

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `anear`

![Attempt 1](2024-01-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `anear` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 340 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[relet trode tired tried throe]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `tired`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-01-10/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `tired` gives us 3 correct letters, 0 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 3
