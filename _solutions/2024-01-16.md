# Wordle for January 16, 2024 - \#941

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `hired`

![Attempt 1](2024-01-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `hired` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `i`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[d]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
