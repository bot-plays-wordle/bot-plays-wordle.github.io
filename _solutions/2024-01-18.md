# Wordle for January 18, 2024 - \#943

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tuner`

![Attempt 1](2024-01-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tuner` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `n`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 206 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dealt delta ethal lathe lithe]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lithe`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-01-18/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lithe` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 4: `[a b c d f g j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`
