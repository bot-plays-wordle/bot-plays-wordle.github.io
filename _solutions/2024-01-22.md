# Wordle for January 22, 2024 - \#947

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `nacre`

![Attempt 1](2024-01-22/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `nacre` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `c`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 191 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dealt delta ethal death heald]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `delta`, let's see what it gives us
