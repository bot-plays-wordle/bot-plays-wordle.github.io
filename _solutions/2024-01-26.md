# Wordle for January 26, 2024 - \#951

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `retia`

![Attempt 1](2024-01-26/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `retia` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `t`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 637 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal laund ulnad lohan bland]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `nodal`, let's see what it gives us
