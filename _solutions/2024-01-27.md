# Wordle for January 27, 2024 - \#952

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `nacre`

![Attempt 1](2024-01-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `nacre` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n a e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2
