# Wordle for February 3, 2024 - \#959

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rowel`

![Attempt 1](2024-02-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rowel` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `w`, `e`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 211 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[thorn orant trona nitro snort]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v x y z]`

Next guess is `trona`, let's see what it gives us
