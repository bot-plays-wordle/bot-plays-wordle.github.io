# Wordle for February 6, 2024 - \#962

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `treed`

![Attempt 1](2024-02-06/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `treed` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1720 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lohan uhlan linch lynch aloin]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lohan`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-02-06/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lohan` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `o`, `a`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[h]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 4: `[b c f g h i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c f g h i j k m p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `mushy`, let's see what it gives us

Word should contain letters `[h]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c f g h i j k p q v w x z]`

At position 2: `[b c f g h i j k p q v w x z]`

At position 3: `[b c f g i j k p q v w x z]`

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...

At position 1: `[b f g h i j p q v w x z]`

At position 2: `[h]`

At position 3: `[i]`

At position 4: `[c]`

At position 5: `[b f g h i j p q v w x z]`

It must be `which`

![Attempt 5](2024-02-06/attempt-5.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `which`!

## Conclusion

Today's word is `which` and it took 5 attempts to guess it
