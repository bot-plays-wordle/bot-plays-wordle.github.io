# Wordle for February 15, 2024 - \#971

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `refit`

![Attempt 1](2024-02-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `refit` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `f`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 106 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[slant plant blunt daunt shalt]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[t]`

Next guess is `blunt`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-02-15/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `blunt` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `u`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

Not a bad guess in general
