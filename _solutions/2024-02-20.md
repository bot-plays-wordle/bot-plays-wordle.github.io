# Wordle for February 20, 2024 - \#976

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `goner`

![Attempt 1](2024-02-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `goner` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `g`, `o`, `n`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1104 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[datil dital tidal shalt lathy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f h i j k l m p q s t u v w x y z]`

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
