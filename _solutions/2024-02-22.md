# Wordle for February 22, 2024 - \#978

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lathe`

![Attempt 1](2024-02-22/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `lathe` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a h e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 31 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[shear acher reach herma hepar]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `shear`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-02-22/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `shear` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a h e]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 6 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[henna bohea heapy peach heavy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 4: `[b c d e f g i j k m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `henna`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Word should contain letters `[a h e]`

Could be a better guess
