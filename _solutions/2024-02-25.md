# Wordle for February 25, 2024 - \#981

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `laser`

![Attempt 1](2024-02-25/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `laser` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `a`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[s]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 260 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[stond shunt snout stoun tonus]`

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`
