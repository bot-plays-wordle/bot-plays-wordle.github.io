# Wordle for February 29, 2024 - \#985

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `t`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
