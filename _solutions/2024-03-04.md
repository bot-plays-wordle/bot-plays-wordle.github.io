# Wordle for March 4, 2024 - \#989

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `prone`

![Attempt 1](2024-03-04/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `prone` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `r`, `o`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
