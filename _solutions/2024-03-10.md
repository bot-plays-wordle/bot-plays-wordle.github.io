# Wordle for March 10, 2024 - \#995

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rathe`

![Attempt 1](2024-03-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rathe` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 302 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[loran ulnar urnal gnarl drail]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ulnar`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-03-10/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `ulnar` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `l`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r a]`
