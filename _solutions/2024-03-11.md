# Wordle for March 11, 2024 - \#996

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `u`, `b`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
