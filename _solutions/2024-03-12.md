# Wordle for March 12, 2024 - \#997

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `eldin`

![Attempt 1](2024-03-12/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `eldin` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `d`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

Not a bad guess in general
