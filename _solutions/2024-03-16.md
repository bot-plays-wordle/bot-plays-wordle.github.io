# Wordle for March 16, 2024 - \#1001

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `naker`

![Attempt 1](2024-03-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `naker` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `k` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `k`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 293 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[linty clint glint flint blunt]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `blunt`, let's see what it gives us
