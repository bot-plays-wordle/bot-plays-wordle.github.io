# Wordle for March 17, 2024 - \#1002

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `drest`

![Attempt 1](2024-03-17/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `drest` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r s t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q r t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[t]`

Next guess is `slart`, let's see what it gives us
