# Wordle for March 18, 2024 - \#1003

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `idler`

![Attempt 1](2024-03-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `idler` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `d`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 224 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[leant lento olent blent glent]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `leant`, let's see what it gives us
