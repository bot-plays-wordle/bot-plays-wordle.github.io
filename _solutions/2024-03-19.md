# Wordle for March 19, 2024 - \#1004

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `nurse`

![Attempt 1](2024-03-19/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `nurse` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `u`, `r`, `s`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
