# Wordle for March 31, 2024 - \#1016

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `yearn`

![Attempt 1](2024-03-31/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `yearn` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `y`, `e`, `r`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 606 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dotal datil dital tidal altho]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x z]`

Next guess is `tidal`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `d`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information
