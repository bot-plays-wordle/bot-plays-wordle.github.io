# Wordle for April 5, 2024 - \#1021

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `liver`

![Attempt 1](2024-04-05/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `liver` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `v`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
