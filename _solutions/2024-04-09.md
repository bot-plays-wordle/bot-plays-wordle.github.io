# Wordle for April 9, 2024 - \#1025

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `alder`

![Attempt 1](2024-04-09/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `alder` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `l`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 287 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[trone inert retin trine stern]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `trine`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-04-09/attempt-2.png)
