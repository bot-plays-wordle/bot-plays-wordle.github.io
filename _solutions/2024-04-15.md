# Wordle for April 15, 2024 - \#1031

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `idler`

![Attempt 1](2024-04-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `idler` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `l`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 197 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[thine entia neist cetin tinge]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`
