# Wordle for April 22, 2024 - \#1038

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `aster`

![Attempt 1](2024-04-22/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `aster` gives us 2 correct letters, 2 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a s e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 10 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laser sayer caser spaer saber]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[r]`

Next guess is `laser`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-04-22/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `laser`!

## Conclusion

Today's word is `laser` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
