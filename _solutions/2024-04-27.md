# Wordle for April 27, 2024 - \#1043

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `awner`

![Attempt 1](2024-04-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `awner` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `w`, `n`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
