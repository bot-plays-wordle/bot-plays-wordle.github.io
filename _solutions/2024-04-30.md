# Wordle for April 30, 2024 - \#1046

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `remit`

![Attempt 1](2024-04-30/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `remit` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `m`, `i`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 502 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[loran ulnar urnal gnarl knurl]`

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q r s u v w x y z]`
