# Wordle for May 3, 2024 - \#1049

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `react`

![Attempt 1](2024-05-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `react` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `a`, `c`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
