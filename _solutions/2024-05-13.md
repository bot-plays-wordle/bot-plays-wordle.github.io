# Wordle for May 13, 2024 - \#1059

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `blent`

![Attempt 1](2024-05-13/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `blent` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `e`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
