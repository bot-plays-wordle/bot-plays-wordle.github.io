# Wordle for May 16, 2024 - \#1062

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `olden`

![Attempt 1](2024-05-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `olden` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `d`, `e`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 390 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[thirl thurl trail trial trawl]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h i j k m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `trawl`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-05-16/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `trawl` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` should be at position 3

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `w`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l t a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 1 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[stall]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m p q s u v x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h i j k m p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 3: `[a]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 5: `[l]`

It must be `stall`
