# Wordle for May 17, 2024 - \#1063

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `citer`

![Attempt 1](2024-05-17/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `citer` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` should be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `i`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 11 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[altar satyr gator sutor butyr]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b d f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[t]`

At position 4: `[a b d f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[r]`

Next guess is `satyr`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-05-17/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `satyr` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `a`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t r]`

Could be a better guess
