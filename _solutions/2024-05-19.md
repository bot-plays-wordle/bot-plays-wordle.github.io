# Wordle for May 19, 2024 - \#1065

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `treed`

![Attempt 1](2024-05-19/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `treed` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 540 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notal ontal slant plant natal]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `notal`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-05-19/attempt-2.png)
