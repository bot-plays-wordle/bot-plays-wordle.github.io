# Wordle for May 27, 2024 - \#1073

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ruble`

![Attempt 1](2024-05-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ruble` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `b`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 429 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[noter tenor toner inert inter]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `toner`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-05-27/attempt-2.png)
