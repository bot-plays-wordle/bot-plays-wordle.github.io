# Wordle for May 28, 2024 - \#1074

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `plier`

![Attempt 1](2024-05-28/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `plier` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `l`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 451 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[idant hiant nitid night dhoti]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h j k m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dhoti`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-05-28/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `dhoti` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `h`, `o`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i]`

Could be a better guess
