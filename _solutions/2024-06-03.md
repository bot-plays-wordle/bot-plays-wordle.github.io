# Wordle for June 3, 2024 - \#1080

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `arpen`

![Attempt 1](2024-06-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `arpen` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `e`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 344 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[rotal slart ultra clart blart]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k l m o q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ultra`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-06-03/attempt-2.png)

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
