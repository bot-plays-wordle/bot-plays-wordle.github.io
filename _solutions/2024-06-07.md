# Wordle for June 7, 2024 - \#1084

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ortet`

![Attempt 1](2024-06-07/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ortet` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 208 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[alone anole dhole melon pelon]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dhole`, let's see what it gives us
