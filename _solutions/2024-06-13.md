# Wordle for June 13, 2024 - \#1090

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `namer`

![Attempt 1](2024-06-13/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `namer` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 204 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[ontal tolan tonal slant plant]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `tonal`, let's see what it gives us
