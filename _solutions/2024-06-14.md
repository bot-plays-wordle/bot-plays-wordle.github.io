# Wordle for June 14, 2024 - \#1091

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `miler`

![Attempt 1](2024-06-14/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `miler` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `i`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 350 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notal ontal tonal slant plant]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h j k n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `notal`, let's see what it gives us
