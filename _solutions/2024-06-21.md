# Wordle for June 21, 2024 - \#1098

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `unred`

![Attempt 1](2024-06-21/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `unred` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `r`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 475 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notal tolan tonal slant plant]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h i j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `tonal`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-06-21/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `tonal` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n t a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n t a i]`

Not a bad guess in general
