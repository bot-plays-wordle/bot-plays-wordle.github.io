# Wordle for June 24, 2024 - \#1101

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `berth`

![Attempt 1](2024-06-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `berth` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `e`, `r`, `t`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1396 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal nidal laund ulnad gland]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `nidal`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-06-24/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `nidal` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `i`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[d l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
