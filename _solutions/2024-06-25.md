# Wordle for June 25, 2024 - \#1102

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `caner`

![Attempt 1](2024-06-25/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `caner` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` should be at position 2

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `n`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 35 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[talar tayir satyr tabor gator]`

At position 1: `[a b d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[r]`

Next guess is `tabor`, let's see what it gives us
