# Wordle for July 4, 2024 - \#1111

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `olent`

![Attempt 1](2024-07-04/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `olent` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `l`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 68 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[derat caret react armet ramet]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[t]`

Next guess is `ramet`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `ramet` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `a`, `m`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e t]`

Not a bad guess in general
