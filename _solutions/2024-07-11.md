# Wordle for July 11, 2024 - \#1118

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `torse`

![Attempt 1](2024-07-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `torse` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `s`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 69 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[olden olein pelon pleon felon]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `olein`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-07-11/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `olein` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o e]`

Could be a better guess

So far we know that possible letters are:

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
