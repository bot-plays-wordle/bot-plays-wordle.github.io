# Wordle for July 14, 2024 - \#1121

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ureal`

![Attempt 1](2024-07-14/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ureal` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `r`, `a`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 565 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[noted toned teind tined thine]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `noted`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-07-14/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `noted` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e o d]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 1 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[video]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f g h i j k m p q s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[b c e f g h i j k m o p q s v w x y z]`

It must be `video`

![Attempt 3](2024-07-14/attempt-3.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `video`!

## Conclusion

Today's word is `video` and it took 3 attempts to guess it
