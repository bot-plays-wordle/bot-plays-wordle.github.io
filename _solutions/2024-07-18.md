# Wordle for July 18, 2024 - \#1125

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lager`

![Attempt 1](2024-07-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `lager` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `a`, `g`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 280 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[trone inert retin trine stern]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `retin`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-07-18/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `retin` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
