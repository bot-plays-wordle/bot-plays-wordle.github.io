# Wordle for July 21, 2024 - \#1128

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `reply`

![Attempt 1](2024-07-21/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `reply` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `p` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `l`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e p]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 89 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[enapt paten adept paned piend]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o q s t u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x z]`

Next guess is `paned`, let's see what it gives us
