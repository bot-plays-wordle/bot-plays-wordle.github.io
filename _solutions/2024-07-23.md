# Wordle for July 23, 2024 - \#1130

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `pater`

![Attempt 1](2024-07-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `pater` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` should be at position 1

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `t`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[p r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 29 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[pirol prion pirny prong prink]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[p]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `prink`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-07-23/attempt-2.png)

Letter `n` should be at position 4

Letter `k` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `k`) but it's also important piece of information

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
