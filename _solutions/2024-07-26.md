# Wordle for July 26, 2024 - \#1133

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `enorm`

![Attempt 1](2024-07-26/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `enorm` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `n`, `o`, `r`, `m`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 965 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[datil dital shalt lathy latch]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lathy`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-07-26/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lathy` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `t`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a h]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
