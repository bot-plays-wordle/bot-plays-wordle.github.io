# Wordle for July 27, 2024 - \#1134

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `veldt`

![Attempt 1](2024-07-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `veldt` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `v`, `l`, `d`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u w x y z]`

Next guess is `rhine`, let's see what it gives us
