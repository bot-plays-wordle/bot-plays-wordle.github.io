# Wordle for August 10, 2024 - \#1148

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `trier`

![Attempt 1](2024-08-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trier` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 159 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eldin elain olein elsin lenis]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `elsin`, let's see what it gives us
