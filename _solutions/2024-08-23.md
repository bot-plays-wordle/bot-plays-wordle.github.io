# Wordle for August 23, 2024 - \#1161

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `entry`

![Attempt 1](2024-08-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `entry` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `t`, `r`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 767 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[heald dhole aloed ideal slade]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x z]`

Next guess is `ideal`, let's see what it gives us
