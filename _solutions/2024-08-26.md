# Wordle for August 26, 2024 - \#1164

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `thegn`

![Attempt 1](2024-08-26/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `thegn` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `g`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 266 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[artel later ratel liter luter]`
