# Wordle for September 15, 2024 - \#1184

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `heder`

![Attempt 1](2024-09-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `heder` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 2

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `d`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 16 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[tenor belar velar fetor lemur]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[e]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[r]`

Next guess is `tenor`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `tenor` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `n`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
