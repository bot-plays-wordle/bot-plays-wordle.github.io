# Wordle for September 19, 2024 - \#1188

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `waler`

![Attempt 1](2024-09-19/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `waler` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `w`, `a`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 299 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[trone inert retin trine urent]`
