# Wordle for October 2, 2024 - \#1201

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `urate`

![Attempt 1](2024-10-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `urate` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `r`, `a`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 458 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[olden eldin lined blend neeld]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lined`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-10-02/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lined` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 44 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[welsh flesh shelf melch chelp]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 5: `[b c f g h j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 1: `[b c e g h j k m o p q s v w x y z]`
