# Wordle for October 5, 2024 - \#1204

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lathe`

![Attempt 1](2024-10-05/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `lathe` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `a`, `t`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 599 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[runed unred ender noser seron]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ender`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-10-05/attempt-2.png)

Letter `r` should be at position 5
