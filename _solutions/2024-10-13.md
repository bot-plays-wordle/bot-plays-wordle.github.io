# Wordle for October 13, 2024 - \#1212

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tuned`

![Attempt 1](2024-10-13/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tuned` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `u`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 174 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[enrol heron rhine yearn crena]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `heron`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `heron` gives us 0 correct letters, 4 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n e r o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 6 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[irone snore onery prone enorm]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g i j k l m n p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g i j k l m o p q r s v w x y z]`

Next guess is `enorm`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2024-10-13/attempt-3.png)

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `m`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n e r o]`

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
