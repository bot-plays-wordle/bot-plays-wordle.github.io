# Wordle for October 24, 2024 - \#1223

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tined`

![Attempt 1](2024-10-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tined` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `i`, `n`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1247 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[horal larch ralph hurly whorl]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Word should contain letters `[o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
