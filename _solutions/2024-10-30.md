# Wordle for October 30, 2024 - \#1229

Attempt for `retie` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `t`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
