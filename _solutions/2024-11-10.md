# Wordle for November 10, 2024 - \#1240

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `thane`

![Attempt 1](2024-11-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `thane` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 186 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[enrol runed unred ender olden]`

At position 1: `[b c d e f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d e f g i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `unred`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-11-10/attempt-2.png)
