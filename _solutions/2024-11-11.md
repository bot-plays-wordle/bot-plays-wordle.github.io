# Wordle for November 11, 2024 - \#1241

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `forel`

![Attempt 1](2024-11-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `forel` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `f`, `r`, `e`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 328 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[stond thong dhoti atony ayont]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `atony`, let's see what it gives us
