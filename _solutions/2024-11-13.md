# Wordle for November 13, 2024 - \#1243

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rinse`

![Attempt 1](2024-11-13/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rinse` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `s`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r i]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 144 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[thirl trail trial trill triad]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q r t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q r t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q r t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q r t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `trill`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-11-13/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `trill` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 2

Letter `i` should be at position 3

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
