# Wordle for November 25, 2024 - \#1255

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ripen`

![Attempt 1](2024-11-25/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ripen` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `p`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 41 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[thorn toran loran starn adorn]`

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l m n o q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[n]`

Next guess is `adorn`, let's see what it gives us

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
