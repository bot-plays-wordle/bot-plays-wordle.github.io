# Wordle for December 2, 2024 - \#1262

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `trove`

![Attempt 1](2024-12-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trove` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `o`, `v`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 323 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[anile slane ulnae lance plane]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q s u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `plane`, let's see what it gives us
