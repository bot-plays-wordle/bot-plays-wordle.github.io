# Wordle for December 7, 2024 - \#1267

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `henry`

![Attempt 1](2024-12-07/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `henry` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` should be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `n`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[h y]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 22 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[hotly hasty haily haply hatty]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[h]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[y]`

Next guess is `hatty`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `hatty` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
