# Wordle for December 11, 2024 - \#1271

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `trike`

![Attempt 1](2024-12-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trike` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `k` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `r`, `i`, `k`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1104 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal laund ulnad bland gland]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h j l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h j l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `laund`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `laund` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` should be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l u]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
