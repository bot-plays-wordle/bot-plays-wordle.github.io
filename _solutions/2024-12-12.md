# Wordle for December 12, 2024 - \#1272

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` should be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `a`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information
