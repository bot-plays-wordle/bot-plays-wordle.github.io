# Wordle for December 14, 2024 - \#1274

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `chert`

![Attempt 1](2024-12-14/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `chert` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `h`, `e`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 490 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[loran ulnar urnal drail radon]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `drail`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-12-14/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `drail` gives us 3 correct letters, 0 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` should be at position 1

Letter `r` should be at position 2

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r d l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[d]`

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
