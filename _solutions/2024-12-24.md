# Wordle for December 24, 2024 - \#1284

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `blore`

![Attempt 1](2024-12-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `blore` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `o`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 78 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lathe tilde anile istle stile]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a c d e f g h i j k m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `istle`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-12-24/attempt-2.png)
