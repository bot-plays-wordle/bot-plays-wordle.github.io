# Wordle for December 26, 2024 - \#1286

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `teras`

![Attempt 1](2024-12-26/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `teras` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `e`, `r`, `s`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 591 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laund bland gland aland honda]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `laund`, let's see what it gives us
