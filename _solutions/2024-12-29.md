# Wordle for December 29, 2024 - \#1289

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `snore`

![Attempt 1](2024-12-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `snore` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `n`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 350 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dotal altho loath litho thiol]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `altho`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2024-12-29/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `altho` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `t`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
