# Wordle for January 3, 2025 - \#1294

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `liter`

![Attempt 1](2025-01-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `liter` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `i`, `t`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 464 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[shend hynde snead decan amend]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `hynde`, let's see what it gives us
