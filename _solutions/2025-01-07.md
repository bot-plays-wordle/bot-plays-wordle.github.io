# Wordle for January 7, 2025 - \#1298

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tined`

![Attempt 1](2025-01-07/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tined` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2
