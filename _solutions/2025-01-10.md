# Wordle for January 10, 2025 - \#1301

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `hired`

![Attempt 1](2025-01-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `hired` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `i`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 408 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[rotal slart orant rotan trona]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `orant`, let's see what it gives us
