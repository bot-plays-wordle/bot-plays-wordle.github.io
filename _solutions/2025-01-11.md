# Wordle for January 11, 2025 - \#1302

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `chert`

![Attempt 1](2025-01-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `chert` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `h`, `e`, `r`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1291 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal nidal laund ulnad bland]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `bland`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-01-11/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `bland` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n d]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[d f g i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[d f g i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[f g i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `nidus`, let's see what it gives us

Word should contain letters `[n d i]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
