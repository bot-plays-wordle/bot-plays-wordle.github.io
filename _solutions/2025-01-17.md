# Wordle for January 17, 2025 - \#1308

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `trine`

![Attempt 1](2025-01-17/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `trine` gives us 2 correct letters, 0 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

Right now we have 60 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drape grade drake druse drome]`
