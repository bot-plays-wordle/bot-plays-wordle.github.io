# Wordle for January 27, 2025 - \#1318

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `arles`

![Attempt 1](2025-01-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `arles` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `r`, `l`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[s]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 231 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[stond shunt snout stoun suint]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `shunt`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-01-27/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `shunt`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.

## Conclusion

Today's word is `shunt` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
