# Wordle for January 29, 2025 - \#1320

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `irone`

![Attempt 1](2025-01-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `irone` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `o`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 340 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[alert later ratel taler luter]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `luter`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-01-29/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `luter` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e u]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 3 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[usher udder umber]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
