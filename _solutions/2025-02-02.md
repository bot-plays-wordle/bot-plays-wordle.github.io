# Wordle for February 2, 2025 - \#1324

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `outre`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `outre` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 4

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 13 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[snore blore chore whore afore]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[r]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `chore`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-02-02/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `chore`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.

## Conclusion

Today's word is `chore` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
