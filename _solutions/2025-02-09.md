# Wordle for February 9, 2025 - \#1331

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `olden`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-09/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `olden` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `d`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 130 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[trona nitro tronc front rhino]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g h i j k m n p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `rhino`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-02-09/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `rhino` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `h`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o n]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 41 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[tonga nokta snout tonus tongs]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c f g j k m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g j k m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g j k m p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `snout`, let's see what it gives us
