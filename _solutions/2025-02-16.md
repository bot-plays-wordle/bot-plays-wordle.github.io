# Wordle for February 16, 2025 - \#1338

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `grein`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `grein` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `g`, `r`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 669 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dealt delta lated ethal lathe]`

At position 1: `[a b c d e f h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`
