# Wordle for February 20, 2025 - \#1342

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `arete`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `arete` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `laird`, let's see what it gives us
