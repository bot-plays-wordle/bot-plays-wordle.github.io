# Wordle for February 21, 2025 - \#1343

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `beryl`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-21/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `beryl` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `r`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
