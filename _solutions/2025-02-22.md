# Wordle for February 22, 2025 - \#1344

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `parle`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-22/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `parle` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
