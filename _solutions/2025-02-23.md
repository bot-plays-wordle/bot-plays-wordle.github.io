# Wordle for February 23, 2025 - \#1345

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `freit`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `freit` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `f`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 67 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[later ratel taler antre noter]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e g h j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e g h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `later`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-02-23/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `later` gives us 3 correct letters, 0 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` should be at position 3

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3
