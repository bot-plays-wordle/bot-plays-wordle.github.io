# Wordle for February 24, 2025 - \#1346

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `lifer`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `lifer` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `f`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 412 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notal ontal tolan tonal slant]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d g h j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `ontal`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-02-24/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `ontal` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l n a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
