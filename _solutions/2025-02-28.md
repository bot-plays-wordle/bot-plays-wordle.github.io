# Wordle for February 28, 2025 - \#1350

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `mpret`

![Attempt 1](2025-02-28/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `mpret` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `p`, `r`, `e`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1230 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal nidal laund ulnad bland]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l n o q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l n o q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l n o q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l n o q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l n o q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `bland`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-02-28/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `bland` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `a`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

At position 3: `[c f g h i j k o q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[c f g h i j k o q s u v w x y z]`

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Word should contain letters `[u]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
