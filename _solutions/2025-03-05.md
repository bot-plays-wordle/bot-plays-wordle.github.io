# Wordle for March 5, 2025 - \#1355

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `velar`

![Attempt 1](2025-03-05/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `velar` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `v`, `e`, `l`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
