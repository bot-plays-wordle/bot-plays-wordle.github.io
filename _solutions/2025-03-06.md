# Wordle for March 6, 2025 - \#1356

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rance`

![Attempt 1](2025-03-06/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rance` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `c`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r a e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 94 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[alert artel derat tread alder]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b d e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `alder`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-03-06/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `alder` gives us 2 correct letters, 2 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` should be at position 1

Letter `l` should be at position 2

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r a e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a]`
