# Wordle for March 18, 2025 - \#1368

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `brute`

![Attempt 1](2025-03-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `brute` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `u`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r t e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 90 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[later ratel taler liter tiler]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `taler`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
