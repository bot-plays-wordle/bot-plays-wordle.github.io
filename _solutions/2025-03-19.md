# Wordle for March 19, 2025 - \#1369

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `laten`

![Attempt 1](2025-03-19/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `laten` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `t`, `e`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
