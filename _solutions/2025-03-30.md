# Wordle for March 30, 2025 - \#1380

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `brine`

![Attempt 1](2025-03-30/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `brine` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `r`, `i`, `n`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1015 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dotal altho loath shalt lathy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a c d f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a c d f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lathy`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-03-30/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lathy` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `h`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 24 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[adust ducat coast costa atmos]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d f g j k m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[c d f g j k m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 3: `[a c d f g j k m o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a c d f g j k m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a c d f g j k m o p q s t u v w x z]`

Next guess is `ducat`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2025-03-30/attempt-3.png)

Attempt for `ducat` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` should be at position 2

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `c`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a t u]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 4

Right now we have 1 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[quota]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a f g j k m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[u]`

At position 3: `[a f g j k m o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[f g j k m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a f g j k m o p q s u v w x z]`

It must be `quota`

![Attempt 4](2025-03-30/attempt-4.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `quota`!

Today's word is `quota` and it took 4 attempts to guess it
