# Wordle for March 31, 2025 - \#1381

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `retia`

![Attempt 1](2025-03-31/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `retia` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `i`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 134 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[blunt stond cloth lowth month]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `stond`, let's see what it gives us
