# Wordle for April 3, 2025 - \#1384

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `artel`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `artel` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 100 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[redan yearn nacre rance enarm]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `yearn`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-04-03/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `yearn` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `y`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r e]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 27 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[farde shear rache raphe ramie]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k m o p q r s u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k m o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f g h i j k m o p q r s u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k m o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d e f g h i j k m o p q r s u v w x z]`

Next guess is `shear`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2025-04-03/attempt-3.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `shear`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.

## Conclusion

Today's word is `shear` and it took 3 attempts to guess it
