# Wordle for April 5, 2025 - \#1386

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `nurse`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-05/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `nurse` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `u`, `r`, `s`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 923 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dotal datil dital altho loath]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dital`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `i`, `t`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
