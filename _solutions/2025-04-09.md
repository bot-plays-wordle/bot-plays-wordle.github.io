# Wordle for April 9, 2025 - \#1390

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rhine`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-09/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rhine` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` should be at position 2

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[h e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 35 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[sheal cheat theca thema chela]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[h]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `theca`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-04-09/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `theca` gives us 2 correct letters, 2 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

Letter `e` should be at position 3

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more
