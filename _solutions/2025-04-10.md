# Wordle for April 10, 2025 - \#1391

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tenor`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tenor` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` should be at position 1

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t o r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 20 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[troll torah thorp thoro thort]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[t]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `troll`, let's see what it gives us
