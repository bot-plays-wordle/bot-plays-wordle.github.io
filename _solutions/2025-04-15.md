# Wordle for April 15, 2025 - \#1396

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `delta`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `delta` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `l`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 297 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nares caner nacre rance enarm]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c e f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `enarm`, let's see what it gives us
