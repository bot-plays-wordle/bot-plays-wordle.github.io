# Wordle for April 16, 2025 - \#1397

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tiger`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-16/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tiger` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `i`, `g`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 451 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[loran urnal knurl adorn radon]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f h j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `radon`, let's see what it gives us

Attempt for `radon` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information
