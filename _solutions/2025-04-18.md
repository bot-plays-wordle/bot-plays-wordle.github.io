# Wordle for April 18, 2025 - \#1399

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ceorl`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ceorl` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `o`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 372 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[inter niter trine tuner urent]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d e f g h i j k m n p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b d f g h i j k m n p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b d e f g h i j k m n p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d e f g h i j k m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b d e f g h i j k m n p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `tuner`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `u`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

Not a bad guess in general
