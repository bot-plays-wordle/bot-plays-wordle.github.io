# Wordle for April 23, 2025 - \#1404

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `recta`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `recta` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `c`, `t`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 483 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[olden eldin lined unled blend]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lined`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-04-23/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lined` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `i`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 20 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[shone pheon sheng foehn phene]`
