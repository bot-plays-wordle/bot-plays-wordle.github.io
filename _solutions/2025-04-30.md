# Wordle for April 30, 2025 - \#1411

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `crept`

![Attempt 1](2025-04-30/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `crept` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `p`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 454 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[renal enrol alder lader redan]`

At position 1: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o q r s u v w x y z]`
