# Wordle for May 13, 2025 - \#1424

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `unred`

![Attempt 1](2025-05-13/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `unred` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 236 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[rathe their chert retch therm]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k l m o p q r s t v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m o p q r s t v w x y z]`

Next guess is `retch`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-05-13/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `retch` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `c`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

Could be a better guess
