# Wordle for May 15, 2025 - \#1426

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `blore`

![Attempt 1](2025-05-15/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `blore` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
