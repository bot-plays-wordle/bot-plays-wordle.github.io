# Wordle for May 20, 2025 - \#1431

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `mater`

![Attempt 1](2025-05-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `mater` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `a`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 222 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[enrol drone ronde redly heron]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d e f g h i j k l n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d e f g h i j k l n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d e f g h i j k l n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `redly`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-05-20/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `redly` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `l`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 77 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[irone norie snore inure urine]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c e f g h i j k n o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[b c f g h i j k n o p q r s u v w x z]`

At position 3: `[b c e f g h i j k n o p q r s u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[b c f g h i j k n o p q r s u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[b c e f g h i j k n o p q s u v w x z]`

Next guess is `urine`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2025-05-20/attempt-3.png)

Attempt for `urine` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `i`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c e f g h j k n o p q s v w x z]`
