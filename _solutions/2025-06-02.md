# Wordle for June 2, 2025 - \#1444

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `mater`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `mater` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `m`, `a`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
