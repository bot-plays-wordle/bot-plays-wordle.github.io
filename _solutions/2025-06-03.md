# Wordle for June 3, 2025 - \#1445

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `eland`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `eland` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a n d]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 30 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[adorn radon dinar nadir randy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k m o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `randy`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-06-03/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `randy` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a n d]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 7 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[admin adown undam divan indan]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k m o p q s t u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x z]`

Next guess is `adown`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2025-06-03/attempt-3.png)

Attempt for `adown` gives us 3 correct letters, 0 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` should be at position 1

Letter `d` should be at position 2

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `w`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a n d]`

Could be a better guess



## Attempt 4

Right now we have 2 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[admin adman]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a]`

At position 2: `[d]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m p q s t u v x z]`

At position 4: `[a b c f g h i j k m p q s t u v x z]`

At position 5: `[n]`

![Attempt 4](2025-06-03/attempt-4.png)

If we look into details, we can see that:

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `a`) but it's also important piece of information

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...

At position 1: `[a]`

At position 2: `[d]`

It must be `admin`

![Attempt 5](2025-06-03/attempt-5.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `admin`!

## Conclusion

Today's word is `admin` and it took 5 attempts to guess it
