# Wordle for June 7, 2025 - \#1449

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `snore`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-07/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `snore` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[s r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 25 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[tarse druse arise urase carse]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m p q r t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `carse`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-06-07/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `carse` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Word should contain letters `[s r e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 3 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[druse pryse reuse]`
