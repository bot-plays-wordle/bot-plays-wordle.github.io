# Wordle for June 11, 2025 - \#1453

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `noted`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `noted` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `o`, `t`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[d]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 56 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[laird liard lyard lurid shard]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[d]`

Next guess is `shard`, let's see what it gives us
