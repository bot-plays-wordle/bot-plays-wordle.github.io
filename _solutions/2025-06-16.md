# Wordle for June 16, 2025 - \#1458

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `riley`

Attempt for `riley` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `y` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `i`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e y]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
