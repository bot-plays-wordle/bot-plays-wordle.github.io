# Wordle for June 17, 2025 - \#1459

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `abler`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-17/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `abler` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 317 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drant orant rotan toran trona]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `trona`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-06-17/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `trona` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` should be at position 2

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` should be at position 4

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 5 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drank crank prank franc wrang]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[c d f g h i j k m n p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[r]`

At position 3: `[a c d f g h i j k m n p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[n]`

At position 5: `[c d f g h i j k m n p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `franc`, let's see what it gives us

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
