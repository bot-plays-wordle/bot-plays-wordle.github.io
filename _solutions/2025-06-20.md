# Wordle for June 20, 2025 - \#1462

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `carte`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `carte` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` should be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a t e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 6 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lathe taupe tawie tawse tatie]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a]`

At position 3: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `taupe`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-06-20/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `taupe`!

## Conclusion

Today's word is `taupe` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
