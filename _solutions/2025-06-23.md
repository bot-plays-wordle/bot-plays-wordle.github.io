# Wordle for June 23, 2025 - \#1465

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tined`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `tined` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `i`, `n`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[d]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 144 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[dural lardy drawl lordy dolor]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `dural`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-06-23/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `dural` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `r`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information
