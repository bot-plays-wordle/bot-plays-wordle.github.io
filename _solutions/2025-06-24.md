# Wordle for June 24, 2025 - \#1466

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `oriel`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `oriel` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` should be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `o`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i e l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

Next guess is `stile`, let's see what it gives us
