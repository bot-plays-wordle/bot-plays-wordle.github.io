# Wordle for June 25, 2025 - \#1467

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `laver`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-25/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `laver` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `a`, `v`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 829 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[stond nitid notch month thong]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

Next guess is `stond`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-06-25/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `stond` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `t`, `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 75 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[ohmic ophic hoick pouch cough]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c f g h i j k m o p q u w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c f g h i j k m o p q u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c f g h i j k m o p q u w x y z]`
