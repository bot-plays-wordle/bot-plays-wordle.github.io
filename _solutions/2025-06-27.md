# Wordle for June 27, 2025 - \#1469

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `unred`

![Attempt 1](2025-06-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `unred` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `r`, `e`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
