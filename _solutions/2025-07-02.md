# Wordle for July 2, 2025 - \#1474

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `truce`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-02/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `truce` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `c` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r u c]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 16 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[clour cornu incur runic curdy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `incur`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-07-02/attempt-2.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `incur`!

To be honest that was a pretty lucky guess, but it worked out well.

## Conclusion

Today's word is `incur` and it took 2 attempts to guess it
