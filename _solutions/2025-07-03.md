# Wordle for July 3, 2025 - \#1475

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `blent`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `blent` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `e`, `n`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1079 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[hoard shard hardy hydro hurds]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d f g h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a c d f g h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a c d f g h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d f g h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d f g h i j k m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `hardy`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `h`, `a`, `r`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[y]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
