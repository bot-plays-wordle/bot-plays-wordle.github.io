# Wordle for July 4, 2025 - \#1476

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rebut`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-04/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rebut` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e u]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 64 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[unred alure ureal inure urine]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a c d f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `inure`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-07-04/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `inure` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r e u]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 10 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[urase aurae purse surge purge]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 4: `[a c d e f g h j k l m o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `aurae`, let's see what it gives us

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
