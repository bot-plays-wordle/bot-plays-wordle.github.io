# Wordle for July 11, 2025 - \#1483

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `soler`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `soler` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `o`, `l`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 384 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[drant riant train arnut ranty]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q r t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q r t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q r t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n p q t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `train`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-07-11/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `train` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

Letter `r` should be at position 2

Letter `a` should be at position 3

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more
