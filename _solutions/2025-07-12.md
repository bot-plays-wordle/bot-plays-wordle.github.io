# Wordle for July 12, 2025 - \#1484

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `namer`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-12/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `namer` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `m` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `a`, `m`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 488 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[tilde thole delft veldt ethyl]`
