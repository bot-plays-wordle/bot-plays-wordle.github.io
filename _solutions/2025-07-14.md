# Wordle for July 14, 2025 - \#1486

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `goner`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-14/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `goner` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `g` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `g`, `o`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 274 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[slant plant natal clint blunt]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f h i j k l m p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f h i j k l m n p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `plant`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-07-14/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `plant` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `l`, `a`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n]`

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 35 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nidus unbid unkid undid indic]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f h i j k m n q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f h i j k m q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f h i j k m n q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `nidus`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2025-07-14/attempt-3.png)

Attempt for `nidus` gives us 1 correct letters, 3 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `s`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n i d u]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 4

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f h i j k m q u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[d]`

At position 4: `[b c d f h i j k m q v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f h i j k m n q u v w x y z]`

It must be `undid`
