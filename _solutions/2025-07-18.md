# Wordle for July 18, 2025 - \#1490

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `antre`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `antre` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `n`, `t`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 215 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lurid lordy world dolor droll]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `world`, let's see what it gives us
