# Wordle for July 20, 2025 - \#1492

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `parle`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `parle` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 206 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notal ontal tolan tonal slant]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `tonal`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-07-20/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `tonal` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `o`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a l n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 16 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[bland aland slain blain algin]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k m n q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `bland`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2025-07-20/attempt-3.png)

Attempt for `bland` gives us 4 correct letters, 0 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` should be at position 1

Letter `l` should be at position 2

Letter `a` should be at position 3

Letter `n` should be at position 4

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a l n b]`

Not a bad guess in general

At position 1: `[b]`

At position 2: `[l]`
