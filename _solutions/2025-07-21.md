# Wordle for July 21, 2025 - \#1493

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `crept`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-21/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `crept` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `r`, `e`, `p`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2
