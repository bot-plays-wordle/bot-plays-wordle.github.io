# Wordle for July 23, 2025 - \#1495

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `pater`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-23/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `pater` gives us 4 correct letters, 0 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` should be at position 2

Letter `t` should be at position 3

Letter `e` should be at position 4

Letter `r` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `p`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a t e r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 9 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[later dater cater mater gater]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a]`

At position 3: `[t]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[r]`

Next guess is `dater`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-07-23/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `dater` gives us 4 correct letters, 0 present letters and 1 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a t e r]`

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 8 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[later cater mater gater water]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c e f g h i j k l m n o q r s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a]`

At position 3: `[t]`

At position 4: `[e]`

At position 5: `[r]`

Next guess is `water`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 3](2025-07-23/attempt-3.png)

That's the correct answer! The word is `water`!

## Conclusion

Today's word is `water` and it took 3 attempts to guess it
