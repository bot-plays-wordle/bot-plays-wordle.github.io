# Wordle for July 24, 2025 - \#1496

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `bluer`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-24/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `bluer` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `l`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[u e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 63 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[unode indue dunce upend endue]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a c d e f g h i j k m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `indue`, let's see what it gives us

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
