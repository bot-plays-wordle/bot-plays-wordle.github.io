# Wordle for July 28, 2025 - \#1500

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `tuner`

![Attempt 1](2025-07-28/attempt-1.png)

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `u`, `n`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general
