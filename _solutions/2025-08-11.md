# Wordle for August 11, 2025 - \#1514

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `wrest`

![Attempt 1](2025-08-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `wrest` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `w`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[s t]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 108 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[stand stond snath litas latus]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q t u v x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v x y z]`

Next guess is `stand`, let's see what it gives us
