# Wordle for August 12, 2025 - \#1515

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `throe`

![Attempt 1](2025-08-12/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `throe` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 424 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal unold aloin sloan solan]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `unold`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-08-12/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `unold` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `d` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `u`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information
