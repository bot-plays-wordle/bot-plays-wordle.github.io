# Wordle for August 17, 2025 - \#1520

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `orate`

![Attempt 1](2025-08-17/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `orate` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `a`, `t`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 387 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[unold dhoni noily colin sonly]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `unold`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-08-17/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `unold` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `u` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o u l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 5 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lough lousy solum bolus locum]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 4: `[b c f g h i j k m o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c f g h i j k l m o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lousy`, let's see what it gives us
