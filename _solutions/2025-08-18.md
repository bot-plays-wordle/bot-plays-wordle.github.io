# Wordle for August 18, 2025 - \#1521

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `paren`

![Attempt 1](2025-08-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `paren` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `p` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `p`, `a`, `r`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 494 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[tilde thole delft veldt ethyl]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d e f g h i j k l m o q s t u v w x y z]`
