# Wordle for August 29, 2025 - \#1532

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `naker`

![Attempt 1](2025-08-29/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `naker` gives us 0 correct letters, 2 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `k` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `k`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 251 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[rotal trial slart ultra clart]`
