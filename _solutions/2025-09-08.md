# Wordle for September 8, 2025 - \#1542

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ratel`

![Attempt 1](2025-09-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ratel` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `t`, `e`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 252 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nidor unrid drony drown drink]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `nidor`, let's see what it gives us
