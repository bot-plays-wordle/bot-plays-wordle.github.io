# Wordle for September 14, 2025 - \#1548

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `other`

![Attempt 1](2025-09-14/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `other` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `o` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 1

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 502 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal unold aloin salon sloan]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `aloin`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `a`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[o i n]`
