# Wordle for September 18, 2025 - \#1552

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `certy`

![Attempt 1](2025-09-18/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `certy` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `c`, `r`, `t`, `y`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 655 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[eland laden olden eldin lined]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 2: `[a b d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 3: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 4: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

At position 5: `[a b d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x z]`

Next guess is `lined`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-09-18/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lined` gives us 0 correct letters, 3 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `e` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e i n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

So far we know that possible letters are:
