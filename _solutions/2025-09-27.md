# Wordle for September 27, 2025 - \#1561

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `enrol`

![Attempt 1](2025-09-27/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `enrol` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `n`, `o`, `l`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[r]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2
