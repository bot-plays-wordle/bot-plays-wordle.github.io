# Wordle for October 1, 2025 - \#1565

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `teras`

![Attempt 1](2025-10-01/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `teras` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `s` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `e`, `r`, `a`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[s]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 192 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[sonly lysin sling slonk slink]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `slink`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-10-01/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `slink` gives us 1 correct letters, 2 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` should be at position 1

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `k` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier
