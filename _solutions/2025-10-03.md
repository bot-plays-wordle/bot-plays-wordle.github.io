# Wordle for October 3, 2025 - \#1567

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `biter`

![Attempt 1](2025-10-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `biter` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `i`, `t`, `e`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 997 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal laund ulnad lohan unold]`
