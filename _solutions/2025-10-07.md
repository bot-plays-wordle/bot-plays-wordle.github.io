# Wordle for October 7, 2025 - \#1571

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `ender`

![Attempt 1](2025-10-07/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `ender` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 2

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `e`, `d`, `r`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[n]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 535 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[notal tolan tonal slant plant]`

At position 5: `[a b c f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `plant`, let's see what it gives us
