# Wordle for October 8, 2025 - \#1572

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `react`

![Attempt 1](2025-10-08/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `react` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `c` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `e`, `c`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 660 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[nodal nidal laund ulnad lohan]`
