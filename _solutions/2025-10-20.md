# Wordle for October 20, 2025 - \#1584

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `rivel`

![Attempt 1](2025-10-20/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `rivel` gives us 1 correct letters, 1 present letters and 3 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` should be at position 2

Letter `v` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `v`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 77 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[linty litho light linch filth]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 2: `[i]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k m n o p q s t u w x y z]`

Next guess is `linty`, let's see what it gives us
