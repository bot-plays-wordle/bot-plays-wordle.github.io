# Wordle for October 22, 2025 - \#1586

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `delft`

![Attempt 1](2025-10-22/attempt-1.png)

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `e`, `l`, `f`) but it's also important piece of information
