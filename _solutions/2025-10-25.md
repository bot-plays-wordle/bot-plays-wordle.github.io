# Wordle for October 25, 2025 - \#1589

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `thine`

![Attempt 1](2025-10-25/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `thine` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `t`, `h`, `i`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

At position 4: `[a b c d e f g j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `blore`, let's see what it gives us
