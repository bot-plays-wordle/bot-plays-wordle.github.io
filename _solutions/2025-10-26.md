# Wordle for October 26, 2025 - \#1590

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `neath`

![Attempt 1](2025-10-26/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `neath` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `n`, `e`, `a`, `t`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 666 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[lurid lordy world dolor droll]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[b c d f g i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[b c d f g i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[b c d f g i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[b c d f g i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[b c d f g i j k l m o p q r s u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `world`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-10-26/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `world` gives us 0 correct letters, 1 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `w` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 4

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `w`, `o`, `r`, `d`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[l]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 5: `[b c f g i j k l m p q s u v x y z]`
