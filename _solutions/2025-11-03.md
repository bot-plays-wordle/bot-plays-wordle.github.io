# Wordle for November 3, 2025 - \#1598

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `brute`

![Attempt 1](2025-11-03/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `brute` gives us 1 correct letters, 0 present letters and 4 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `b` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `u` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `b`, `r`, `u`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[e]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 337 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[alone anole anile slane dhole]`

At position 1: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q s v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[e]`

Next guess is `slane`, let's see what it gives us

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3
