# Wordle for November 10, 2025 - \#1605

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `snore`

![Attempt 1](2025-11-10/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `snore` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `s` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `s`, `n`, `o`, `r`, `e`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 764 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[datil dital lathy latch latah]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[a b c d f g h i j k l m p q t u v w x y z]`

Next guess is `lathy`, let's see what it gives us

![Attempt 2](2025-11-10/attempt-2.png)

Attempt for `lathy` gives us 2 correct letters, 1 present letters and 2 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `a` should be at position 2

Letter `t` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `y` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `l`, `h`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[a t y]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words



## Attempt 3

Right now we have 4 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[facty tammy tabby taggy]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c d f g i j k m p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c d f g i j k m p q t u v w x y z]`

At position 5: `[y]`

Next guess is `tammy`, let's see what it gives us

This was a waste, almost no valuable information...
