# Wordle for November 11, 2025 - \#1606

## Attempt 1

This is the first attempt and we'll choose a random word to start with.

Let's start with word `delft`

![Attempt 1](2025-11-11/attempt-1.png)

Attempt for `delft` gives us 0 correct letters, 0 present letters and 5 wrong letters.

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `d` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `e` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `l` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `f` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `t` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Some letters are missing (like `d`, `e`, `l`, `f`, `t`) but it's also important piece of information

So far we don't know any of the letters!

Not a bad guess in general



## Attempt 2

Right now we have 1460 words to choose from and best of them seem to be `[rohan sharn rhino rohun horny]`

So far we know that possible letters are:

At position 1: `[a b c g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 2: `[a b c g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 3: `[a b c g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

At position 4: `[a b c g h i j k m n o p q r s u v w x y z]`

If we look into details, we can see that:

Letter `r` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `h` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `i` is on a different spot - this means that it cannot be at position 3

Letter `n` is not present in the word and we will not use it any more

Letter `o` should be at position 5

We got information about the correct letters and it should make next attempt easier

Some letters are missing (like `r`, `h`, `n`) but it's also important piece of information

Word should contain letters `[i o]`

That was a great guess that limited number of remaining words
